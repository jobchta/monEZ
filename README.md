## Post-Bugfix Deployment and Test Instructions

### Recent render.js Critical Fix

A critical syntax error in `render.js` was recently identified and resolved. This fix addresses issues that prevented proper application initialization and rendering.

### Deployment Recommendations

After the render.js restoration, follow these deployment steps:

1. **Clear Cache**: Ensure all browser and server-side caches are cleared to prevent serving stale versions of the file
2. **Redeploy**: Perform a complete redeployment of the application to ensure all changes are properly propagated
3. **Verify Build**: Confirm that the build process completes successfully without errors

### UI Health Verification Checklist

Maintainers should verify the following after deployment:

- [ ] Application loads without console errors
- [ ] render.js is properly loaded and executed
- [ ] All UI components render correctly
- [ ] Interactive elements respond as expected
- [ ] No JavaScript runtime errors in browser console
- [ ] Application initialization completes successfully
- [ ] Core functionality is operational
- [ ] Performance metrics are within acceptable ranges

### Troubleshooting

If issues persist after deployment:

1. Check browser console for any remaining JavaScript errors
2. Verify that the correct version of render.js is being served
3. Confirm cache has been properly cleared on both client and server
4. Review deployment logs for any warnings or errors
5. Test in multiple browsers to isolate browser-specific issues
